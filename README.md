# Immunid â€” Opinionated Data Storage

* Robust relational data handling
* Absolutely no view layer
* Leverage an existing event system (EventEmitter)
* Modularize via CommonJS
* No reliance on jquery for ajax
* No reliance on underscore or lodash for functions
* Promises, not callbacks
* Emphasis on mixins

## Installation

Immunid is distributed with [npm](npm) and can be imported as CommonJS modules.

```bash
npm install immunid --save
```

### Retrieving Data

All models must be created or retreived through the store. The store is what
allows relational behavior, caching, and identity mapping. It is strictly
possible to create a new instance of a model directly, but it will not be able
to retrieve any associations.

```javascript
// Performs a GET to `/posts/1`
store.find('post', 1).then(function(post) {
});
```

All data returned from the `GET` request to `/posts/1` will be parsed into the
appropriate location within the store and wrapped in a corresponding model
object. This allows the post to synchronously retrieve associated data. This
mechanism relies on embedded ids within the parent record, which is the `post`
in this example:

```javascript
post.get('comment_ids'); // [1, 2, 3]
post.comments(); // No request, returns an array of comments
```

In some situations it isn't feasible to pass down all of the associated records
along with the parent. When that happens and you need to retrieve the associated
data you can specify that a request should be made, along with some optional
parameters:

**WIP**

```javascript
post.comments({ fetch: true, page: 1 }); // GET /post/1/comments?page=1
```

The path used for a particular model or relation can be customized within the
model itself. There is no `basePath` or automatic id appending.

```javascript
var Comment = Model.extend({
  path: function(post) {
    return '/post/' + post.id + '/comments';
  }
});
```

### Persisting Records

Records instantiated through the store expose some simple persistence methods.

```javascript
model.save();
model.reload();
model.destroy();
```

Persisting models with associations does not create, update, or destroy any of
the associated models.
